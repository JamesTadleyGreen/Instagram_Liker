instagram.py will load up instagram in Chromium browser, log into instagram using USERNAME and PASSWORD variables,
pick a random hashtag, and then proceed to like a random number of photos within a given range.

To only run the script a maximum of once every 23 hours (for lesser chance of being banned) run wait-instagram.py
instead.

Place shortcut to runscript.bat in startup folder. Find startup folder (Windows) by pressing Windows Key + R and
then entering "shell:startup". This is a convenient way to run the script often.
